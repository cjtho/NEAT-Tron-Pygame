# Tron Game with AI and NEAT Implementation

## Description
This project is a modern rendition of the classic Tron game, developed using Pygame. It features captivating visuals and introduces additional mechanics to enhance the gameplay experience. The highlight of this project is its dual AI approach: a custom-developed, manually coded AI designed for "human-like" play, and a NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm implementation.

The manually coded AI provides a challenging yet intuitive opponent, mimicking human play style. On the other hand, the NEAT implementation explores the fascinating world of AI learning and evolution. Although the NEAT algorithm currently struggles to master Tron effectively, it offers an intriguing insight into AI development challenges.

## Features
- **Engaging Visuals**: Enhanced graphics for a more immersive Tron experience.
- **Custom AI Opponent**: A specially designed AI that simulates human-like playing patterns.
- **NEAT Algorithm**: An implementation of the NEAT algorithm to evolve and train AI through self-play.
- **Human vs. AI Gameplay**: Players can test their skills against the custom AI or the best performing NEAT-trained AI.

## NEAT Algorithm Challenges
The current implementation of the NEAT algorithm in this project faces significant difficulties in mastering Tron. Numerous configurations and approaches have been tried, but they have yet to yield successful learning outcomes. This presents an exciting area for future exploration and development.

## Future Work
- **Enhancing the NEAT Algorithm**: Focused efforts on getting the NEAT algorithm to a point of convergent behavior.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implementing reinforcement learning techniques to further improve AI performance.
- **UI Enhancements**: Adding more UI features to visualize the AI learning process and make the game more user-friendly.
